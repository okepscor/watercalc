<h2>Manual for the Oklahoma Water Use Calculator</h2>
<p>The Oklahoma Water Use Calculator is a resource for any individual interested in estimating their water usage and its related costs. It was developed based on the model from the Southwest Florida Water Management District's Water Use Calculator and adapted to include Oklahoma water rates which are available from the Oklahoma Municipal League and individual providers (Oklahoma Municipal League, 2017; City of Norman, 2017; City of Stillwater, 2017).</p>
<p>The Oklahoma Water Use Calculator compiles water usage for different household activities and calculates the cost of total water consumption based on individuals self-reported water use and their local water rates. The water calculator also calculates the savings users can get with a 10% reduction of their total water usage. We encourage users to try out the calculator using all the potential uses or just one to see who much water is typically used in different activities and what the related cost is.</p>


<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Where did the data come from?</h3>
<p>The water rates for all municipalities in Oklahoma except Norman and Stillwater come from Oklahoma Municipal Utility Cost, 2016. Available at <a href="http://oml.org/Articles/Utility%20Report%20Final.pdf">http://oml.org/Articles/Utility%20Report%20Final.pdf</a>. Accessed on September 12, 2017.</p>
<p>The water rates for Norman come from City of Norman, 2017. Available at <a href="http://www.normanok.gov/finance/utility-service-rates">http://www.normanok.gov/finance/utility-service-rates</a>. Accessed on September 12, 2017.</p>
<p>The water rates for Stillwater come from City of Stillwater, 2017. Available at <a href="http://stillwater.org/files/customer-service/Residential-Water-Rates-Web2017.pdf">http://stillwater.org/files/customer-service/Residential-Water-Rates-Web2017.pdf</a>. Accessed September 12, 2017.</p>

<h3>How is the water cost calculated?</h3>
<p>Water cost = Sum of (Minimum charge + Water Consumption Block <i>I</i> * Water Rate Block <i>I</i>)
<br/>Where <i>I</i> represents different blocks of water consumption, for example, Block 1=5000 gallons, Block 2= 10,000 gallons, and so on. Different municipalities have different blocks (2, 3, or 4) for water consumption and their respective water rates.</p>

<h3>Why isn’t my city included?</h3>
<p>Data is publicly available for the cities listed. Please use the Oklahoma average or multiply gallons used by 0.1 for a 10% reduction and ask your utility for the price per gallon to see how much you save.</p>

<h3>Why doesn’t the amount match my bill?</h3>
<p>Your self-reported use is an approximation and can differ from actual use.</p>
